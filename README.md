# Arudino Dot-matrix Display Adapter Library

![Build flag](https://github.com/galjonsfigur/Arduino-DotMatrixLibrary/workflows/platformio-build.svg)

This project is an Arduino-compatible library for an [PD243x IÂ²C Display Adapter Board](https://github.com/galjonsfigur/PD243X-I2C-Adapter).
It can be used on any Arduino-compatible environment that supports `Wire`
library. Tested on Arduino Uno and STM32 "Blue Pill" boards, but should work fine
regardless of the board as long as there is Arduino platform for it. It can be
used both with Arduino IDE and PlatformIO environments.
