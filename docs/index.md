This project is an Arduino-compatible library for an PD243x IÂ²C Display Adapter Board.
PD245x displays are small four-digit alphanumeric dot-matrix displays avarible in various colors.

It can be used on any Arduino-compatible environment that supports `Wire`
library. Tested on Arduino Uno and STM32 "Blue Pill" boards, but should work fine
regardless of the board as long as there is Arduino platform for it.
